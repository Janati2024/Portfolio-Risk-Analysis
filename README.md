# Portfolio-Risk-Analysis

## This project involves building an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze financial data, focusing on customer segmentation, asset distribution, returns over time, and risk assessment. The dashboard provides insights into customer demographics, investment patterns, and financial performance.

## Objective
This dashboard aims to:

Provide a structured view of customer demographics and investment activities.
Analyze financial trends to make data-driven decisions.
Assess risk and return to guide investment strategies.

## Key Components of the Dashboard
1. Customer Location Count
Displays the number of customers across different locations.
The current visualization shows customer distribution, with the Dubai Campus having the highest count.
2. Customer Details
A breakdown of customers by location with their full names.
Helps identify specific customer accounts associated with each location.
3. Asset Classes
Visualizes different asset classes under-investment, categorized by major and minor classifications.
Provides insight into investment diversification.
4. Returns Over Time
A time series analysis of the rate of return (RoR) from 2017 to 2023.
Uses a dual-color line chart to differentiate trends.
Identifies performance fluctuations, volatility, and outliers.
5. Risk and Returns
A scatter plot comparing the standard deviation (risk) and average return.
It helps in assessing the risk-return tradeoff of various investments.
